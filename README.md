# Password-strength-checker
A simplistic password strength checker program that gives you a score from 0 to 5 about your password's strength and also it gives you some hints to help you to make your password stronger.
I hope my project helped you, I know that it's not a big thing but for me is something that I wanted to share, so have fun.

I maked the exe with pyinstaller, I also watched this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT23SLTBRQo

Do not forget to tell me if you find any bugs or you think you have a better approach.
